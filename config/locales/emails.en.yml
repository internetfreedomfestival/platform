        Dear friend,

        This is an automatic notification to inform you that you have been moved to the IFF 2018 waiting list, as a result of not confirming your attendance.

        This action can’t be reversed by any special circumstances.

        Please note that the Internet Freedom Festival is a nonprofit organization, and one of the few international gatherings of its kind to offer totally free attendance. Our entire team works very hard to keep it that way, and closely controlling attendance, for both safety and to provide the experience for everyone.

        Thank you for your interest and understanding.

        We hope we can see you next year :)

        Lots of love, 
        The IFF Team

        Dear friend,

        We’re glad to inform you that you have been moved from the waitlist
        to the attendee list to join us at the Internet Freedom Festival 2018.
        If you can no longer attend, please let us know immediately so we can
        transfer your spot to somebody else.

        Looking forward to seeing you in Valencia!
